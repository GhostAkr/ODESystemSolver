		initial_vals::Tuple{Real}, max_stage::Integer, c_coeffs::Tuple{Real}, 
		b_coeffs::Tuple{Real}, a_coeffs::Tuple{Tuple{Real}})

Solve system of ODEs using Runge - Kutta method. System of ODE can be represented as
follows: ``y' = f(t, y), y(t_0) = y_0`` where y is a vector. To achieve more accurancy
this method uses Richardson's extrapolation to control step during the computational 
process.

Return dictionary in following format: `<t>: <y(t)>` where `t` is Real and `y(t)` is
Vector{Real}.

Function `f` takes ``t`` and vector ``y`` and returns vector of real values which length
is equal to the length of ``y``.

``c`` and ``b`` coefficients are stored as usual tuples where each element of tuple
denotes coefficient for appropriate stage. ``a`` coefficients are represented as nested 
tuples. Each internal tuple contains coeffcients of one method's stage. For example for 
4-staged method we consider following structure of ``a`` coefficients:
((a21), (a31, a32), (a41, a42, a43)). Length of tuples with coefficients should 
correspond to `max_stage` value.

# Arguments
- `f::Function`: right part of the system of ODEs;
- `t_limits::Tuple{Real}`: system argument limits;
- `initial_step::Real`: initial step;
- `initial_val::Tuple{Real}`: initial values (``y_0``);
